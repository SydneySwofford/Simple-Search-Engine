In Collier County, Florida – which was struck by Hurricane Ian last year – the increase was expected to be from around $1,050 per year to nearly $4,000. \n  ", "\n      The math isn’t working for some homeowners who have seen their premiums skyrocket.\n  ", "\n      “When you see this huge spike – doubling, tripling, quadrupling of your insurance rate – all of a sudden those finances don’t make sense to regular people,” he said.  \n  ", "\n      Faced with higher premiums, some homeowners who don’t carry a mortgage are choosing to forgo insurance altogether – leaving them unprotected if a disaster hits, said Amy Bach, the executive director at United Policyholders, an insurance consumer-advocacy group.\n  ", "\n      It’s hard to know exactly how many homeowners are choosing to “go bare” without insurance, Bach said, because she believes many aren’t willing to self-report their choice.

Facilities for handwashing and showering are the responsibility of individual camps.\n  ", "\n      The festival suggests a long list of gear for each attendee, including food and beverages, an “extensive” first aid kit, warm clothing and fire extinguishers. \n  ", "\n      Additionally, “Burners,” what the event dubs attendees, should bring a “poop bucket,” especially in case rain makes porta potties inoperable. The website recommends a 5-gallon utility bucket with a lid and garbage bag liners. \n  ", "\n      And the list goes on: Attendees are urged to bring a portable shower, waterproof protective bags for any electronic gear, a battery- or solar-powered radio and warm clothing since temperatures can drop by as much as 50 degrees when the sun goes down.\n  ", "\n      In the case of rain, Burning Man emphasizes the importance of wood blocks to help keep generators and other electronic devices dry and electrical tape to seal off connections.\n  ", "\n      Nicole Gallub, who has attended four Burning Man events, said despite her prior experience and serious preparations, she still wasn’t ready for this year’s intense rain. “I don’t think anybody was really prepared for what we experienced,” said Gallub, who left the event during a pause in the downpour. “Typically, it rains, and it stops – but it just didn’t stop raining.”\n  ", "\n      Amid the difficult weather, the atmosphere was “peaceful” when she left, she said. “Everybody else was pretty calm and helping each other,” Gallub said. “I would have felt actually okay if we stayed, too, even though it would have been very uncomfortable.”\n  ", "\n      Like Maltsava, Gallub said preparing for the worst is a crucial part of the Burning Man experience. “You have to basically plan out the next seven days on your own in the desert,” she said. “It takes quite a bit of planning to get it right.”\n  ", "\n      And despite the organizers’ best efforts to prepare and warn attendees, “there’s always people that are not that prepared,” she said.

However, it is an attempt, in accordance with human rights, ethics, and of course, feminism, to protest against the continuation of “violence and sexual harassment of women” by a government that, under the guise of religion, has taken away “femininity” from us as a means to advance its illegitimate power and ambitions. My protest is based on human rights and feminist concerns, but it carries deeper and more profound implications. I cannot simply confine myself to condemning gross violations of human rights and women’s rights. I also intend to address the destructive falsehood and deceit of the government. A government that, with an ideological approach and misuse of spiritual and salvation elements among the people, attempts to control every aspect of individual and social life, under the pretext of family, security, and protection of the “woman,” leaving no aspect of “life” and “feminine identity” outside its oppressive grasp… \n  ", "\n      I want to emphasize that this letter is not written by a free feminist in a developed democratic society, benefiting from civil protest methods and human rights, but rather by an imprisoned woman who, like millions of Iranian women, has been living under the “authority” and “oppression” of a military system with ideological, patriarchal, and tyrannical foundations since the age of 6, deprived of life, youth, “femininity,” and “motherhood”…\n  ", "\n      During the establishment and acquisition of power by the religious regime, there were no better pawns than “women” in the game of religious authorities to adorn the political chessboard with their masculine domination…. . They couldn’t put an abaya and turban on half of the population, i.e., men in society. However, they easily adorned half of Iran’s population with “mandatory hijab,” veil, chador, manteau, and dark-colored trousers to present the odious face of the despotic religious system to the world. In this way, “mandatory hijab” became the showcase of Islamic society and, from the government’s perspective, one of the distinguishing elements and foundations setting apart Islamic society from Western societies…\n  ", "\n      “Mandatory hijab” showcases the image of domination, subjugation, and control over women, which, when extended, makes the control over the entire society smooth and achievable…\n  ", "\n      Hijab was not optional; it was imposed by the government, not based on beliefs and convictions, but to “submit” citizens to government dictates; it was imposed by the government, not based on beliefs and convictions, but to “submit” citizens to government dictates. In clearer terms, compliance with mandatory hijab was a way of training submission and surrendering to oppression in society, not through bullets and executions, but through placing a whip on women’s heads and making it normalized… \n  ", "\n      The justification for all these violent and inhumane confrontations was summarized as preserving the dignity, chastity, and security of women and the well being of Islamic society. Imagine Iranian women who, for 44 years, have been forced to wear a head covering, long coats, and dark-colored pants in the summer heat, and in some places, black chadors. Worse than that, they have been under psychological pressure to strictly adhere to compulsory hijab, all to preserve the image of religious Islamic men and ensure the security and purity of women. Now, those same women are experiencing “sexual assault and harassment” against themselves…\n  ", "\n      Women who experience sexual harassment become filled with anger, fear, and insecurity, but when their womanhood is hidden and suppressed by ideological and religious claims, and at the same time, they are violated in another “situation” (due to protest), they will not only be angry and terrified, but they will also feel deceived and manipulated by the government, which is even more distressing. I have no intention of making any comparisons between women subjected to assault in any “situation” because what women experience in “sexual assault and harassment” leaves such deep scars on their souls and minds that it is difficult to recover from, and perhaps they may never fully recover…\n  ", "\n      The fear, anxiety, and sense of insecurity resulting from the attack by security forces, arrest, and transfer to unknown locations and solitary cells can inflict devastating blows to the individual’s soul and psyche. Experiencing “sexual assault and harassment” in such a “situation” in detention centers, during interrogations, threats, uncertainty, or inside detention vehicles, under the blows and kicks of officers, can be destructive and come with irreparable harm. The governmental male assailants assaulting detained protesting women in detention centers convey the message that nothing, not even what we claimed to be religion, humanity, and spirituality over the past 44 years, can stop us from suppressing and confronting you. Anyone who has experienced confinement in solitary cells and detention centers can comprehend the harsh message of “assault”: that is, we recognize no boundaries in suppressing and dealing with you, and even God does not exist…\n  ", "\n      The “compulsory hijab” was a deceitful scheme against women and a tool of pressure to strengthen the power of the religious government. The “assault” on protesting women by government agents reveals the deceitful, deceptive, and manipulative nature of the government to the people of Iran and the world. Therefore, as a woman prisoner, I confidently declare that we have the power in our protest against the “assault” of government agents on protesting women. We draw this power from the “position” of Iranian women during 44 years of tyranny and coercion by the government in all aspects of our lives and from our struggle and resistance for freedom and rights…\n  ", "\n      This text is not intended as an elegy for Iranian women. It is a testament to the fact that the tyranny and oppression of the government have inflicted incurable wounds on our lives, spirits, and minds. Women were the first, greatest, and most oppressed victims of religious despotism, but they were also the most steadfast, indomitable, and influential social force, and in recent protest and revolutionary movements, they have been at the forefront as the most advanced and radical forces. \n  ", "\n      Iranian women do not derive their credibility and legitimacy of struggle from the intensity of the oppression and discrimination they have endured, but rather from their continuous and courageous resistance and struggle for democracy, life, freedom, equality, human rights, and peace. Their position will be established in the future of our country, and they will determine their rights. \n  ", "\n      We, women, believe that fear, terror, and storms can never shake and tremble the mountains.\n  ", "\n      ", "\n  "]}

Not only does Sheinbaum have the full support of the governing party, she has also long enjoyed the spotlight as mayor of Mexico’s most important city for the last five years until her resignation in June to run for the presidency.\n  ", "\n      On policy, Sheinbaum has vowed to continue many of Lopez Obrador’s policies and programs, including a pension for all senior citizens, scholarships for more than 12 million students and free fertilizers for small farm owners. But the high-profile ex-mayor rejects criticism of her close political alignment with the president. “Of course we’re not a copy (of the president),” she said in July.\n  ", "\n      Still, she does not shy away from touting the principles they share: “For everybody’s good, let’s put the poor first.  There cannot be a rich government if the people are poor. Power is only a virtue when it’s used to serve the people,” Sheinbaum said, repeating the same campaign slogans Lopez Obrador has used for years. \n  ", "\n      Schettino believes the immensely popularly Lopez Obrador views Sheinbaum as his extension in power. He points to their party Morena’s roots in the authoritarian Institutional Revolutionary Party that governed Mexico for more than seven decades until 2000, which came to be known as “The Dinosaur,” and the Party of Democratic Revolution that branched off from it.  \n  ", "\n      In 2012, Lopez Obrador created Morena as a political party. Schettino describes the party today as a “tyrannosaurus” under Lopez Obrador’s influence – representing what he says is the current leader’s desire for a successor to hew closely to his own agenda. “President López Obrador, a dinosaur who not only is a dinosaur, but also has the vocation of a tyrant. He doesn’t want to go. He wants to stay in power,” Schettino said.\n  ", "\n      “I believe that he built Claudia’s candidacy,” Schettino said.\n  ", "\n      López Obrador however has repeatedly dismissed accusations of authoritarian leanings or that he favors a candidate he will be able to control.  Earlier this year, Lopez Obrador denied he had any favorites among his party’s hopefuls or that he was pushing for one candidate or another behind the scenes.  \n  ", "\n      He has also said that he is going “retire completely” after his six-year term in office comes to an end. “I am retiring, I will not participate in any public event again, of course.

Notably, according to a readout from Mexico’s federal immigration agency, Mexico agreed to carry out more costly deportations of the migrants gathering on their side of the border – a move that some believed would dissuade disorderly crossings. \n  ", "\n      The measures, which also specified Mexican efforts to clamp down on the crush of migrants riding north on railcars, are the latest in a series of policy shifts in Mexico that have alleviated, if slightly, the massive political headache in Washington caused perennially by migration. Analysts in both countries see a pragmatic bargain: as Mexico increasingly ", ", the Biden administration has granted rare leeway to the country’s divisive but popular leader. \n  ", "\n      “Mexico has real leverage in the relationship with the US. And right now that leverage is around migration,” said Andrew Selee, the president of the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. \n  ", "\n      Sharing nearly 2,000 miles of land border and a history of important economic exchange, Mexico and the US have long held intertwined immigration policies that adapted as international migration patterns shifted. When George W. Bush made his first trip out of the US as president in 2001, it was to the ranch of Vicente Fox, the Mexican leader, to discuss a new era of cooperation on border issues, like trade, drugs, and the northward flow of Mexicans, who at that time comprised the bulk of undocumented border-crossers.\n  ", "\n      But as spiraling violence and desperate economic conditions fueled years of mass migration out of Central America and the Caribbean to the US, overpowering the country’s legal intake system, the stretch of Mexican territory in between became a critical “buffer state,” said Maureen Meyer of the Washington Office on Latin America.\n  ", "\n      “The Mexico southern border pretty much was the US southern border,” Meyer said. \n  ", "\n      Under pressure from several US administrations, Mexico has repeatedly sent resources to its border with Guatemala over the past 10 years to formalize migration routes and detained record numbers of migrants at newly installed checkpoints as they made their way north. \n  ", "\n      At the helm of Mexico’s latest immigration coordination with the US has been President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a leftist leader who in 2018 campaigned on resistance to doing the US’s “dirty work” on migration. His political calculus has changed swiftly since then.\n  ", "\n      Under the threat of crippling tariffs from then-President Donald Trump, López Obrador agreed in 2019 to allow asylum applicants to wait out their claims inside Mexico under the “Remain in Mexico” policy, roiling activists who said it forced migrants into dangerous living conditions. \n  ", "\n      During the pandemic, when the US employed a public health measure known as Title 42 to turn around many asylum seekers at the border, López Obrador agreed to receive many of the migrants, reversing a long-standing position in the country and straining the resources of Mexico’s own border cities. In May, as the US ended the use of Title 42, López Obrador continued to allow the returns on “humanitarian grounds.”\n  ", "\n      “I think these more recent steps really do cross another line because it is not just stopping people from coming to the United States, which has been the more enforcer role,” Meyer said. \n  ", "\n      “It is actually allowing people deported from the United States to either stay in Mexico, or in this case now, actually maybe actively returning them back to their home countries for the United States,” she said.\n  ", "\n      Details on the deportation plan announced last month have been limited. In a news conference from Washington on Friday, Mexican Foreign Secretary Alicia Bárcena said that Mexican authorities were carrying out six flights each week to return migrants to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Bárcena added that officials were “exploring” the possibility of expanding the returns to Ecuador, Venezuela, and Colombia.\n  ", "\n      It was unclear where the deportation flights were taking place and when they had begun. It also couldn’t be learned if the migrants being returned had already been deported from the US or if they had pending asylum claims. Stakeholders in Mexico told CNN last week that there had not appeared to be any significant change in the pace of repatriation flights in the country’s north.\n  ", "\n      A spokeswoman for Mexico’s federal immigration agency declined to provide more details on the deportations.\n  ", "\n      But the announcement may already have had the effect of discouraging migrants from crossing to the US without the appointment required to seek an asylum claim. In the weekend that followed the meeting, the number of migrants encountered by border authorities entering the US near El Paso, Texas, fell by about 30%, CNN has reported. \n  ", "\n      Last Wednesday, López Obrador also announced that he was planning a summit with officials from several Latin American and Caribbean countries “whose populations are migrating” to be held in the coming days. Mexico also last month agreed to urge countries like Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba — which have limited diplomatic relations with the US — to take back their citizens deported at the border. \n  ", "\n      “What we are looking for is to reach an agreement to confront the migration phenomenon by addressing the causes,” López Obrador said at a news conference. “We have to align ourselves.”\n  ", "\n      The recent cooperation between the two countries has come with a busy schedule of shuttle diplomacy. Last week, Bárcena held meetings in Washington with Senate leaders and Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, Biden’s homeland security advisor. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to travel to Mexico this week along with other cabinet secretaries and meet with López Obrador.\n  ", "\n      For Mexican negotiators, the country’s increased responsibilities have often been conditioned on a US commitment to grow the ways that migrants can enter the country legally, like through temporary work visas and a recently expanded humanitarian parole program that the Biden administration says has allowed tens of thousands of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans who meet certain conditions, including a local sponsor in the US, to fly into the country and secure work authorization. \n  ", "\n      Last month, ahead of the announcement around Mexican deportations, Mexico’s foreign minister told Bloomberg in an interview that the US and Mexico were nearing an agreement with the United Nations to pre-screen tens of thousands of migrants in Mexico for entry into the US under the parole programs. The US has opened similar processing centers in Colombia, Costa Rica, and Guatemala. \n  ", "\n      A United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees spokesperson told CNN that the organization is “regularly in contact with US and Mexican authorities including on how we can provide support to possible future initiatives.”\n  ", "\n      “Politically for the Mexican government, they can’t do enhanced enforcement without showing that they are also fighting for the well-being of migrants and for legal opportunities, because it is a country with a history of migration to the United States,” Selee said.\n  ", "\n      Still, some analysts see a more cynical incentive behind the cooperation, arguing that the Biden administration has largely turned a blind eye to elements of López Obrador’s agenda that would have typically drawn rebuke.\n  ", "\n      “López Obrador very quickly understood that if he gave into Biden’s request for support he would have significant political capital to ensure that US pressure on a number of either bilateral issues or domestic Mexican policy issues would be constrained,” said Arturo Sarukhán, a former Mexican ambassador to Washington who has been a critic of the current administration. \n  ", "\n      Detractors point to democratic backsliding in a number of López Obrador’s positions: an attempted reform of the country’s independent election authority, frequent criticism of the judiciary and the press, and the capitulation of state powers on policing and transportation to the military.\n  ", "\n      The election reform, which was passed earlier this year but later blocked by the Mexican Supreme Court, diminished the country’s independent election authority, cutting its workforce across the country and limiting its autonomy ahead of a presidential vote next year. \n  ", "\n      Tens of thousands of Mexicans marched on the capital against the policy in the largest opposition protest of López Obrador’s presidency. Critics decried it as a dangerous erosion of democratic institutions.\n  ", "\n      But in Washington, the Biden administration was unusually muted. In a statement following the February protests, Ned Price, a senior adviser to Blinken, described “a great debate on electoral reforms on the independence of electoral and judicial institutions that illustrates Mexico’s vibrant democracy.”\n  ", "\n      “We respect Mexico’s sovereignty. We believe that a well-resourced, independent electoral system and respect for judicial independence support healthy democracy,” Price said.\n  ", "\n      If Mexico had less leverage in its relationship with the US, “I think that you’d see greater public pressure from the State Department, from the White House, on the slippery slope of democratic erosion that we’re seeing in Mexico,” Sarukhán said.\n  ", "\n      “I think the United States should be invested in Mexico’s democratic strength because if not, what you’ll have in Washington sooner or later is someone asking the question, ‘Who lost Mexico and why?’” he added.\n  "]}

The 61 dated prints, which were discovered in the Tularosa Basin, near the edge of an ancient lake in White Sands National Park, were made at a time when many scientists think that massive ice sheets had sealed off human passage into North America, indicating that humans arrived in the region even earlier.\n  ", "\n      However, some archaeologists questioned the age of the footprints established by those initial findings. The skeptics noted that aquatic plants such as Ruppia cirrhosa — the one used in the 2021 study — can acquire carbon from dissolved atoms in the water rather than the air, which can result in a misleadingly early date.\n  ", "\n      In ", " published Thursday in the journal Science, researchers said they have produced two new lines of evidence to support their initial dates.\n  ", "\n      “Even as the original work was being published, we were forging ahead to test our results with multiple lines of evidence,” said Kathleen Springer, research geologist at the US Geological Survey and co-lead author on the new Science paper, in a news release.\n  ", "\n      “We were confident in our original ages, as well as the strong geologic, hydrologic, and stratigraphic evidence, but we knew that independent chronologic control was critical.”\n  ", "\n      When and how early humans first migrated to the Americas has long been debated and remains poorly understood. Current estimates for the first inhabitants range from 13,000 years ago to more than 20,000 years ago. However, the earliest archaeological evidence for the region’s settlement is sparse and often controversial, making the footprints especially important.\n  ", "\n      For their follow-up study, the researchers focused on radiocarbon dating of conifer pollen, because it comes from a terrestrial plant and avoids the issues that can arise when dating aquatic plants such as Ruppia, according to the news release.\n  ", "\n      The scientists were able to isolate some 75,000 grains of pollen, collected from the exact same layers as the original seeds, for each sample.

To.org, which works on philanthropic and creative initiatives, surveyed the settlement’s residents on what they wanted in their community — and the response was “a place for dance, music and performance,” explained De Kestelier in a phone call. The project, which was showcased at the ", " in June, follows the successful launch of another music project by To.org: the Karibbean Records recording studio, in Kyebando, Kampala, which went on to produce Ugandan artist Zex Bilangilangi’s 2020 hit track “Ratata.”\n  ", "\n      “Why should millions of people worldwide be denied access to creative spaces simply because they have been displaced due to conflict, climate change or for any other reason?” said Nachson Mimran, co-founder and CEO of to.org, in an email. “Of course, the answer is they shouldn’t. And critically, there’s the fact that music, art, dance and theater are firmly established as meaningful forms of therapy for people with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), which is endemic in Bidi Bidi as it is in other refugee settlements.”\n  ", "\n      In Bidi Bidi, where the majority of residents are under 18 years old, there is a deep need for shared cultural spaces, according to Mawa Zacharia Erezenio, who has been living in the settlement since its early days, after fleeing South Sudan in 2016 when his father was killed during the civil war.\n  ", "\n      Residing in the settlement “is not an easy life,” he said. Since arriving, Erezenio has co-founded one of the organizations collaborating on music programming for the center, Sina Loketa, a non-profit dedicated to supporting the creative and entrepreneurial endeavors of young refugees.\n  ", "\n      One of the difficulties Erezenio faced when he first arrived, he noted, was the simmering tension between displaced members of different tribes. Bringing residents together through the arts “can enable them to start thinking of the future (rather) than fighting among themselves,” he said. “We are bringing different tribes to perform together, and to exchange their cultural dances… We see it as a powerful tool for bringing peace and love among the community.”\n  ", "\n      “When I compare 2023 to 2016 and ‘17, there’s a great difference,” he added, noting that his organization’s work has already helped reduce the “individualism” he believes has been detrimental to the community.\n  ", "\n      In addition to serving as a gathering point, the new building needs to be as efficient as possible, according to De Kestelier. There is little infrastructure in place to support Bidi Bidi’s massive population, with no running water or reliable electricity supply.\n  ", "\n      “We wanted the building to be very low maintenance… to make sure that as little as possible can go wrong,” he explained.\n  ", "\n      To sidestep the need for artificial lighting, sunlight will perforate the brick building through openings and light wells. Its water system doesn’t require pumps, but instead uses gravity, offering another source of clean water to a settlement that currently relies on well water provided by humanitarian agencies and non-profits.\n  ", "\n      “(Rain) water is captured in a big tank and runs down the slope, where the local community can get fresh drinking water, because that’s been a really big issue,” De Kestelier said. “We wanted to make sure that once we build this big roof for shade, we could capture all of the rainwater.”\n  ", "\n      In building the space, De Kestelier said the construction team has been sensitive to which materials might be disruptive. They opted for a prefabricated steel roof, made in Kampala, to avoid relying on local wood, the supply of which is under increased pressure because of the large settlement. For the same reason, they opted for hand-pressed bricks made from local soil rather than ones fired using wood fuel.\n  ", "\n      But beyond practical use and sustainability, De Kestelier wants Bidi Bidi residents to have a new building that feels like their own.\n  ", "\n      “For me, it was important that it stood out,” he explained, citing his experience growing up in Ghent, Belgium (which has a population roughly equivalent to the settlement’s) and the pride he felt in the city’s cultural institutions. “We have an opera theater, an art museum, a design museum — and these are quite often special buildings that make a place.”\n  ", "\n      So far, he is happy with the response to the arts center, which will be completed later this year.\n  ", "\n      “The local community is already calling it ‘The Mushroom,’ which I think is great,” he said with a laugh. “When people give it a name, they own it more.”\n  ", "\n      Erezenio is hopeful that Bidi Bidi, and other settlements like it, will see more projects that provide refugees with “tools for success” in addition to more immediate needs.\n  ", "\n      “All their dreams, all their passion has been destroyed during the war,” he said. “If we get more support and more funding, we can make a lot of transformation.”\n  "]}

The nonprofit grants wishes to young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 who are battling cancer. Nate, the 18-year-old Nik had met in treatment, was the organization’s first wish recipient. He chose to visit his grandmother in California and have a family reunion.\n  ", "\n      Today, the organization grants wishes that run the gamut. They have gifted gaming computers, concert tickets, meet and greet events with celebrities, and vacations.\n  ", "\n      “The one thing in common is it has to bring them joy and know that they’re loved and that we’re fighting for them, too,” Ritschel Boehle said. \n  ", "\n      In April, Abigail Savage, a 23-year-old who was battling terminal cancer, was surprised at her home by Ritschel Boehle and more than a dozen volunteers to let her know her wish was coming true. The group arrived with its 16-foot genie lamp sculpture in tow, built by Ritschel Boehle and her husband for wish deliveries. They carried signs and cheered, making sure Savage knew she had a team of people supporting her.\n  ", "\n      “This was the biggest surprise of my whole life and the best biggest surprise,” Savage told CNN. “The other biggest surprise was cancer. So, this beats that, like, by a lot.”\n  ", "\n      When Savage became too sick to travel by plane to Hawaii, her original wish, her experience was adjusted to something that ultimately became even more meaningful for her and her family. She was able to travel in an RV across the country to her hometown in Montana and visit family before she passed away last month. Savage had battled the disease for five years.\n  ", "\n      “I have obviously never known when my health is going to take a pivot,” Savage said. “So, it’s important to make these kind of memories with my family.”\n  ", "\n      Once the recipient and their family learn that their wish is granted, a dedicated volunteer wish maker works closely with them, making all the arrangements. The goal is that all details are taken care of by the organization so they can just enjoy their wish experience and precious time together.\n  ", "\n      In the beginning, Ritschel Boehle says she wasn’t sure she could be a wish maker and work closely with the young adults – it was too painful for her to relive those memories of Nik. But now, it’s her favorite thing to do. \n  ", "\n      “At first I wasn’t strong enough to do it,” she said. “But I recently helped my 100th person as a wish maker. I just love speaking with them and getting to know them.”\n  ", "\n      Recently, 19-year-old Jordan Morrow received her wish to attend a Taylor Swift concert as part of a trip to Los Angeles.\n  ", "\n      “When I walked into the first day of radiation, they asked me who my favorite singer was, and I said, ‘Taylor Swift.’ And they said, ‘Okay, we’ll try to have some Taylor Swift music playing every day for you.’” Morrow said. “She got me through some hard times.”\n  ", "\n      For Morrow, who has spent the last year battling brain cancer, going to the concert and touring LA has done more than lift her spirits.  \n  ", "\n      “I think it’s something to get me through whatever comes my way,” she said.  “And I’m thankful for Nik’s Wish for that.”\n  ", "\n      In the 11 years since Nik passed away, the organization has granted more than 300 wishes across more than 30 states. But for Ritschel Boehle, the reason behind every wish remains the same. \n  ", "\n      “I think he is looking down from heaven, telling me, ‘I told you, Mom. We can do it. You can do it. They need it. Keep going,’” Ritschel Boehle said. “I think he’s always encouraging me, always helping me out.”\n  ", "\n      ", "\n  ", "\n      ", "\n  "]}

Cork was not involved in the study and reported no conflicts of interest related to the drugs.\n  ", "\n      “Obesity significantly increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, gallbladder disease and stroke. These risks fall dramatically with clinically meaningful and sustained weight loss,” said Cork in a statement given to the nonprofit Science Media Centre. “For the overwhelming majority of patients for whom these drugs are targeted (those with the most severe forms of obesity), the benefits of weight loss far outweigh the risks.”\n  "]}

Typically, pediatrics practices negotiate with insurance companies for reimbursement, and those rates may differ among providers.\n  ", "\n      O’Leary says that because practices don’t know where the numbers will land, some have been reticent to take on the risk of ordering the shots.\n  ", "\n      “For example, here in Colorado, we’ve gotten assurances from our top four payers that they’re going to cover it, but we have not seen dollar amounts yet.

And that’s a hard pill to swallow when we think about health care reimbursements being so challenged.”\n  ", "\n      O’Leary said that he expected the rollout to be rough but that it’s actually going better than in anticipated in some respects because people are working so diligently to try to make it happen.\n  ", "\n      Creech, at Vanderbilt, agreed.\n  ", "\n      “So I think hospitals are going to be creative; pediatricians are going to be creative, But if the federal payors, the insurance carriers and the CDC can be similarly creative and flexible, then we’re going to see a win for patients,” he said.\n  ", "\n      There were moves months ago to try to ensure broader access to the antibody shot.\n  ", "\n      In August, the CDC acted quickly to add Beyfortus to its schedule of routine childhood immunizations, which will eventually trigger full insurance coverage. It also added it to the Vaccines for Children program, which gives no-cost vaccines to children who might not otherwise get them. About half of babies born in the United States each year are eligible for immunizations through that program.\n  ", "\n      Many pediatricians participate in Vaccines for Children, but only about 12% of hospitals do, because it has rules that can be onerous in certain settings.\n  ", "\n      In order to join the program, for example, providers have to agree to carry all vaccines that the program covers. They must also agree to match the vaccines the government gives them with a stock of shots that they buy themselves, and they can’t mix the inventory. This rule was meant to prevent vaccines paid for by the government from going to patients whose insurance would cover the cost.\n  ", "\n      On Tuesday, the CDC relaxed some of those rules so states can allow hospitals and birthing centers to carry a more limited selection of immunizations, including just the ones that are given to newborns: Beyfortus and hepatitis B vaccines.\n  ", "\n      The CDC also said doctors who serve only Medicaid-eligible patients don’t have to buy a separate store of vaccines for privately insured kids. And it has dropped the minimum orders for Beyfortus so states can ship out small numbers of doses in areas where demand for the shots may be low.\n  ", "\n      And doctors can now borrow government doses of Beyfortus to give to paying patients, as long as they replenish the supply within a month or after five doses are borrowed.\n  ", "\n      These flexibilities will help, O’Leary said, but they won’t eliminate all the barriers that are preventing doctors and hospitals from offering Beyfortus.\n  ", "\n      In new guidelines about the Vaccines for Children program, the CDC said it recognizes that it may need to do more to help doctors get Beyfortus to their patients.\n  ", "\n      “CDC is continuing to explore operational policies that can help support these providers and will communicate any changes as soon as possible,” the guidelines say.\n  ", "\n      For now, doctors are urging parents to be patient.\n  ", "\n      “It is such a big lift,” Creech said. The goal is to immunize all babies younger than 8 months of age and children with certain risk factors who are younger than age 2, plus the millions of babies yet to be born this season.

Both the insurance issues and the supply issues have led to hard choices for clinicians like Dushay, who said she ", " with prescribing decisions while knowing there aren’t enough of the medicines to go around.\n  ", "\n      “Because of all these complexities, it’s just made every clinic session just become this layer of being really philosophical about things,” she said. “You’re thinking about everyone’s situation in a way where there’s just more subjectivity in terms of thinking about who needs these medications more.”\n  ", "\n      Finding the medicines may be more difficult in areas with more wealthy people capable of paying out of pocket, Aronne said; he noted that’s been his experience with patients in Manhattan.\n  ", "\n      “We see a lot of businessmen, lawyers, people like that,” he said. “They could potentially afford these things, and they go buy it, so there’s a lesser supply.”\n  ", "\n      And while Mounjaro is already used off-label for weight loss, FDA approval for that use could boost demand even more, if experiences with Ozempic and Wegovy are any indication.
