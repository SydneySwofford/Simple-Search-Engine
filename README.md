# CNN Search Engine

Creator: Sydney Swofford

This simple search engine utilizes Scrappy as well as python to implement 
a web craweler that scans thousands of CNN links based of a search Query, and returns the top
5 most relevant pages based off of document scoring from the inverted index. 

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented code:
<div style="position:relative;width:fit-content;height:fit-content;">
            <a style="position:absolute;top:20px;right:1rem;opacity:0.8;" href="https://clipchamp.com/watch/pgnHzaRFAEF?utm_source=embed&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=watch">
                <img loading="lazy" style="height:22px;" src="https://clipchamp.com/e.svg" alt="Made with Clipchamp" />
            </a>
            <iframe allow="autoplay;" allowfullscreen style="border:none" src="https://clipchamp.com/watch/pgnHzaRFAEF/embed" width="640" height="360"></iframe>
        </div>
